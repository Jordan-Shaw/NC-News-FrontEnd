# React FrontEnd News App
## Background 
This project is a react frontend app which handles data served from a Node.js Express server. It was designed to be used as a news application, with a UI similar to that of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

A hosted version of this project can be viewed [here](https://nc-news-js-frontend.herokuapp.com/). 

A hosted version of this project's relevant back end can be viewed [here](https://nc-news-js.herokuapp.com/api/).
